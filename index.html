      <h3>It takes something more than intelligence </br> to act intelligently.</h3>
      <h3>~Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h3>

      <h1 class="wrapper">Balance does not mean stillness,</br> and peace not quiet?</h1>
      .
      <p class="wrapper">My name is Haven. I am my husband's girlfriend of ten years and a mother of three (plus a pup!). I am also a fulltime partner in my husband's businesses, and have recently taken up coding to contribute to our company's needs.</p>
.
<p class="wrapper">My life is full. It is productive. It is loving, and it can be overwhelming. More and more studies are being brought to the public's attention about what "stress" is and it's effects on health and quality of life. Yet despite the enormity of responsibility that common culture seems  to feel each day, I firmly believe that one “can have it all”.</p>
.
<p class="wrapper">Having it all in life isn't like having all of the shoes, or having all of the Daniel Steele novels. You do not acquire a husband and then he stays.  You do not earn a salary or commission simply by having an impressive resume. </p>
.
<p class="wrapper">For me, having it all means having the willingness to give love and attention where it is needed, to constantly set, maintain, and then reorganize boundaries according to the world around me.</p>
.
<p class="wrapper">And that is the goal of this blog. The articles you'll find here are written by people whom I respect and feel exemplify aspects of a "yogi's" life that anyone can draw from. They are the everyday men and women who'd you'd pass on the street and may or may not notice, and who are smart, creative and accomplished. </p>
.
<p class="wrapper"> So, to get this understanding a bit more underway: "What is a yogi?"</p>

.
